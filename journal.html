                <li>We moved on to the change set which looked something like this 
                  Sandbox - > production
                  Production ->sandbox
                  Sandbox -> sandbox.</li>
                <li>It had the following steps involved Steps :

                 1. Authorized  the connection [sandbox and production]
                 2. Outbound change set -> sending out [sandbox]
                 3. Inbound change set -> [accept][prod]
                 4. Verify and deploy -> [prod]
                  .</li>

                <li>It started with ma'am telling us how to delete records by selecting the id and also that it stays in recycle bin for 15 days and also restoring a data i.e. undelete statement.</li>
                <li>We learnt upsert and its two cases that basically included if a record is having an id or if doesnt have one, the check for update or insert.</li>
                <li>We also started SOQL which is a query language in salesforce and also the select keyword behind it and also that clause is used to apply condition on it.</li>
                <li>Then we learnt a lot of conditional operations and aggregate functions, also grouping by clause.</li>
                <li>Then we moved onto queries, subqueries, also SOSL which is a search language and got to know its syntax.</li>

                <li>Set and map were also discussed in the same manners as others and gave me an indepth understanding of the topic.</li>
                <li>We discussed abstract classes which are basically incomplete classes and also interfaces that only contain incomplete methods.</li>
                <li>We learnt about Sobject data type which once used to keep records for apex as salesforce and also one of the sql operation and application which was interesting.</li>
                <li>We also learnt a really valuable thing that is fetching records be it single or multiple.</li>

                <li>Day started with a discussion with ma'am regarding the types of questions to be asked in the assessment that will be going to take place and what format will it be.</li>
                <li>Ma'am taught us about social madia prototype in the salesforce i.e. Chatter and its importance and uses.</li>
                <li>Now we moved on to the most important part and probably the most thrilling as well, she informed us about apex and how its an extension to java where almost everything is same with some changes.</li>
                <li>Our memories were refreshed with oops,inheritence and everything so that we can move forward with apex.</li>
                <li>We learned about constructors after the break of 15 minutes and did some coding on it to understand it more deeply and continued with inheritence.</li>

                <li>Day started with a discussion with ma'am regarding the assignments lagging behind and us having no learning opportunity as we are just focussing on completing the assignments and the we agreed on a same term of giving it 21st march deadline.</li>
                <li>Then ma'am asked a few questions regarding the previous lecture which was answered gracefully by all of us.</li>
                <li>Now we moved on to data management and its types, how to export and import as well as i realised how easy it is to occupy data by this process and it was interesting.</li>
                <li>Then we also learned queue which is used for assigning the records which dont have any user basically, it also leads and cases all the custom objects.</li>
                <li>We moved on to reports and its types namely tabular,joined, summary and matrix.</li>

                <li>Things started with a couple of questions from ma'am, and I felt it to be quite easy in the meantime we got got started with process builder which comes under Lightening Flow.</li>
                <li>Then we continued our work with the flow builder, its types and process of making it for any profile we want to.</li>
                <li>Creating different flows specially one being where we are obliged to erase all the records, the went on to touch the approval process as well.</li>
                <li>Data Security seems really interesting and quite honestly my favourite part up untill now which included organisation level namely manager and user and also the field level.</li>
                <li>That was it for today and now salesforce is getting way more interesting than i expected.</li>

                <li>This felt like a good session, although i was having fever/jaundice so all of my concentration wasn't there.</li>
                <li>Ma'am taught us how to edit layouts through different perspective and how to accomodate different profiles.</li>
                <li>Two profiles were created with manegerial and clerical attributes and were given different priorities of read only and edit according to their designations.</li>
                <li>We also looked closely at workflow and made a chart which i think will be very useful in upcoming days.</li>
                <li>Since we weren't provided the assignments and class notes for 28th march, we have to do a lot of backlog work today and also have to complete the 4th assignment.</li>
                <li>Ma'am did give us a compensation of completing half of the assigment 4 for today which helps in a big way.</li>
                <li>Long day ahead ahead but i don't want to be left behind so let's get on it.</li>

                <li>Again we had some doubts specially with inserting image into the formulae field which was cleared by ma'am very smoothly.</li>
                <li>Then we learnt how to do lookups, master details was really challenging and i think we need practice on that since it is tricky.</li>
                <li>Today's class was a bit overwhelming since it involved a lot of relations and required to adjoin them with each other and connect.</li>
                <li>We made the pizza app and it was very intriguing, ma'am put a pizza named potato, which i think was really funny.</li>
                <li>We were also taught how read only works and how can we edit various custom objects and put different fields such as prices.</li>
                <li>We also made a yes bank app and it was really nice to tickle different fields.</li>
                <li>I think i will need to utilise the vacation and really practice it to get fast tracked in learning and save some trouble for ma'am.</li>

                <li>Then we learnt the art of creating fields inside an object and also how to exactlty tackle and configure it.</li>
                <li>It was really smooth going since it involved so many interactions from everyone around, such a great learning process.</li>
                <li>I learnt a lot of field types and how to implement it such as auto number, picklist, email, phone, url.</li>
                <li>We also learnt how to put display picture to each individual in contacts, which i think was so cool.</li>

              <li>I learnt that there are 3 service models namely SAAS, PAAS and IAAS and also that sales force works in former two.</li>
              <li>There were some challenges like complexity of website since it was new to me but it seemed easy going once we get hang of it.</li>
              <li>I also learnt to create a home page, configure my settings as well as learning to run a campaign.</li>
              <li>We are also given a task of creating objects, one of them includes reference which might be a challenge.</li>
              <li>All in all it was great to finally come face to face with the website that will probably take a huge chunk of my life.</li>
