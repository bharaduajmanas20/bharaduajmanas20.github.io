                <li>The day started with the revision of yesterday as many of us were having trouble in keeping up with app building phase and hence couldn't hack the second assigment</li>
                <li>Then we learnt the art of creating fields inside an object and also how to exactlty tackle and configure it.</li>
                <li>It was really smooth going since it involved so many interactions from everyone around, such a great learning process.</li>
                <li>I learnt a lot of field types and how to implement it such as auto number, picklist, email, phone, url.</li>
                <li>We also learnt how to put display picture to each individual in contacts, which i think was so cool.</li>
                <li>It felt like i learnt something really valuable and it feels like it will stick with me forever.</li>

              <li>Today I learnt Crm basics from scratch which includes salesforce, creating an object.</li>
              <li>I learnt that there are 3 service models namely SAAS, PAAS and IAAS and also that sales force works in former two.</li>
              <li>There were some challenges like complexity of website since it was new to me but it seemed easy going once we get hang of it.</li>
              <li>I also learnt to create a home page, configure my settings as well as learning to run a campaign.</li>
              <li>We are also given a task of creating objects, one of them includes reference which might be a challenge.</li>
              <li>All in all it was great to finally come face to face with the website that will probably take a huge chunk of my life.</li>
