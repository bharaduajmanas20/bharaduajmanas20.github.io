                <ol>
                    <li>Today I learnt Crm basics from scratch which includes salesforce, creating an object.</li>
                    <li>I learnt that there are 3 service models namely SAAS, PAAS and IAAS and also that sales force works in former two.</li>
                    <li>There were some challenges like complexity of website since it was new to me but it seemed easy going once we get hang of it.</li>
                    <li>I also learnt to create a home page, configure my settings as well as learning to run a campaign.</li>
                    <li>We are also given a task of creating objects, one of them includes reference which might be a challenge.</li>
                    <li>All in all it was great to finally come face to face with the website that will probably take a huge chunk of my life.</li>
