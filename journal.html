                <li>Again we had some doubts specially with inserting image into the formulae field which was cleared by ma'am very smoothly.</li>
                <li>Then we learnt how to do lookups, master details was really challenging and i think we need practice on that since it is tricky.</li>
                <li>Today's class was a bit overwhelming since it involved a lot of relations and required to adjoin them with each other and connect.</li>
                <li>We made the pizza app and it was very intriguing, ma'am put a pizza named potato, which i think was really funny.</li>
                <li>We were also taught how read only works and how can we edit various custom objects and put different fields such as prices.</li>
                <li>We also made a yes bank app and it was really nice to tickle different fields.</li>
                <li>I think i will need to utilise the vacation and really practice it to get fast tracked in learning and save some trouble for ma'am.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>The day started with the revision of yesterday as many of us were having trouble in keeping up with app building phase and hence couldn't hack the second assigment</li>
                <li>Then we learnt the art of creating fields inside an object and also how to exactlty tackle and configure it.</li>
                <li>It was really smooth going since it involved so many interactions from everyone around, such a great learning process.</li>
                <li>I learnt a lot of field types and how to implement it such as auto number, picklist, email, phone, url.</li>
                <li>We also learnt how to put display picture to each individual in contacts, which i think was so cool.</li>
                <li>It felt like i learnt something really valuable and it feels like it will stick with me forever.</li>

          <ol>
              <li>Today I learnt Crm basics from scratch which includes salesforce, creating an object.</li>
              <li>I learnt that there are 3 service models namely SAAS, PAAS and IAAS and also that sales force works in former two.</li>
              <li>There were some challenges like complexity of website since it was new to me but it seemed easy going once we get hang of it.</li>
              <li>I also learnt to create a home page, configure my settings as well as learning to run a campaign.</li>
              <li>We are also given a task of creating objects, one of them includes reference which might be a challenge.</li>
              <li>All in all it was great to finally come face to face with the website that will probably take a huge chunk of my life.</li>
